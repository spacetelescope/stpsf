Documentation for STPSF
===============================

**(Formerly WebbPSF, for versions < 2.0)**

STPSF is a Python package that computes simulated point spread functions (PSFs) for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. STPSF transforms models of telescope and instrument optical state into PSFs, taking into account detector pixel scales, rotations, filter profiles, and point source spectra. It is rather a tool for transforming optical path difference (OPD) maps, created with observatory systems engineering models, into the resulting PSFs as observed with JWST's or Roman's instruments.

   Sample PSFs for the filters in the Roman WFI on SCA01. Note that
   the prism and grism PSFs shown here are monochromatic.

Getting Started with STPSF
----------------------------

See `Using STPSF <usage.html>`_.

.. admonition:: Quickstart Jupyter Notebook

   This documentation is complemented by an `Jupyter Notebook format quickstart tutorial <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/spacetelescope/stpsf/blob/stable/notebooks/STPSF_tutorial.ipynb>`_. Downloading and running that notebook is a great way to get started using STPSF.


.. admonition:: Getting Help

   For help using or installing stpsf, you can contact the STScI JWST Help Desk at jwsthelp.stsci.edu, category STPSF/JWST Telescope.

.. admonition:: How to cite STPSF

    In addition to this documentation, STPSF is described in the following references.  Users of STPSF are encouraged to cite one of these.

    * Perrin et al. 2014, `"Updated point spread function simulations for JWST with STPSF" <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9143E..3XP>`_,  Proc. SPIE. 9143,
    * Perrin et al. 2012, `"Simulating point spread functions for the James Webb Space Telescope with STPSF", <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SPIE.8442E..3DP>`_ Proc SPIE 8842, and
    * Perrin 2011, `Improved PSF Simulations for JWST: Methods, Algorithms, and Validation <Improved_PSFs_for_Webb.pdf>`_, JWST Technical report JWST-STScI-002469.

    In particular, the 2012 SPIE paper gives a broad overview, the 2014 SPIE paper presents comparisons to instrument cryotest data, and the Technical Report document describes in more detail the relevant optical physics, explains design decisions and motivation for STPSF's architecture, and presents extensive validation tests demonstrating consistency between STPSF and other PSF simulation packages used throughout the JWST project.
